<h1>Consider Assisted Living</h1>

<p>Assisted living is a good option for those who need help with daily living.  Do any of the following situations sound familiar to you?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Navigating stairs is becoming a challenge.</li>  
	<li>Home maintenance is no longer manageable.</li>
	<li>Even with family and friends nearby most of your time is spent alone.</li>
	<li>You don't exercise regularly.</li>
	<li>Sometimes you forget to eat meals.</li>
	<li>Cooking for one is too much trouble.</li>
	<li>Sometimes you forget to take your medications.</li>
	<li>You no longer have or enjoy hobbies or regular activities.</li>
	<li>You don't drive any more and don't like asking others for transportation.</li>
	<li>If there were a fire or other emergency you don't have an escape plan you could mange on your own.</li>
	<li>You're not comfortable hiring strangers to come into your home to provide services.</li>
	<li>You're no longer able to care for a loved one by yourself.</li>
</ul>
