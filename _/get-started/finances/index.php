					<h1>Finances</h1>

						<p>Retirement can bring some unique financial questions and situations.  Download our <a class="dk_blue" href="../tools/finance-worksheet.pdf">Financial Worksheet</a> to compare your monthly expenses at home with those that will be covered in an Art&#275;gan community.</p>  

<p>We have many unique payment options available including the services of Elderlife Financial and the Aide and Attendance program through the Veteran's Administration.  Ask your community outreach director at the Art&#275;gan community of your choice.</p> 

<p>The IRS recognizes the cost of care services in assisted living settings as a tax deductible medical expense.  There are specific criteria that must be met in order to qualify for this deduction.  Please consult with your personal tax advisor for details.</p>
