					<h1>Wellness Atmoshpere</h1>

						<p>Walk into any of our communities and you'll feel it; it's who we are.  You'll see it in the eyes and on the faces of residents. You'll hear it in the laughter of people enjoying time together.  You'll taste it in the variety and freshness of the food served.  You'll smell it in the aromatherapy fragrances.  You'll touch it when you're welcomed with a firm handshake.

						<h2>Wellness Program</h2>
						
						
						<p>We agree with the research that says each of us can age successfully by doing what we can to make positive lifestyle choices and by recognizing that our physical, mental and emotional health are connected.</p>  



						<p>Led by qualified and trained Wellness, Resident Service and Events Directors, the Art&#275;gan Wellness Program has five components: <a class="dk_blue" href="physical-health.php">physical health</a>, <a class="dk_blue" href="mental-health.php">brain power</a>, <a class="dk_blue" href="social-life.php">social connections</a>, <a class="dk_blue" href="spirituality.php">spirituality</a> and <a class="dk_blue" href="culinary-experience.php">culinary experience</a>.  Our approach is holistic; we value the interdependence of the individual program components.  A great way to Celebrate the ART of your life.</p>
