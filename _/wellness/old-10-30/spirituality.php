					<h1>Spirituality</h1>
					
					

						<p>More and more research points to spirituality as a critical component of successful aging.  Whether the reference is to a particular religious belief or the notion of a connection to a force, power or sense of deep self, Spring Hill programs are designed with respect for each person's individuality as she defines it.  We believe it's important for each of us to have the opportunity for inner growth.</p>
						
<p>Here's a sample of what you'll find:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Church services</li>
	<li>Meditation groups</li>
	<li>Yoga</li>
	<li>Book clubs</li>
	<li>Discussion groups</li>
	<li>Walking clubs</li>
</ul>
