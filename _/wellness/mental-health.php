					<h1>Brain Power</h1>
					
					

						<p>The brain has an enormous capacity to be able to learn new information and in fact most of us are capable of learning new skills as we age.  At Art&#275;gan we've added LifeLong Learning and Social Connections to physical activity as important components of our Wellness Program. You'll have many opportunities to learn new information, try new tasks and participate in simulating events that are enjoyable AND will increase your Brain Power. Life-long learning is another way we're Celebrating the ART of Life.</p>
