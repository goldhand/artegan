					<h1>Culinary Experience</h1>
					
					

						<p>Eating right and eating well are critical components of successful aging.  We're learning more about the relationship between food, diseases and overall health.  At Art&#275;gan we've designed our Culinary Experience to be delicious, convenient and pleasurable. Our special culinary experience is another way we're Celebrating the ART of Life.</p>  

<p>Our dining rooms are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and you choose when and what you eat.  Select from the breakfast menu or enjoy a made-to-order dish.  For lunch and dinner select from our standard fare or one of our two daily Chef Specials.  At any time of day and whatever you choose you can count on our professional staff combining nutrition and freshness with quality and creativity in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>

<p>Here's a sampling of our community favorites.  To see the complete community sample menu go to the Art&#275;gan community of your choice and click on Sample Menu.  </p>

<ul>
	<li><h2>Cheese Blintz with Raspberry Sauce</h2>
							<p>This sweet, creamy breakfast favorite is made with light, thin crepes and a lightly sweetened blend of three cheeses and with a finishing touch of homemade raspberry sauce.</p>
							
<li><h2>French Toast</h2>
							<p>Texas bread dipped in a creamy egg and cinnamon mixture, grilled until golden brown and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.</p>							
							
<li><h2>Grilled Salmon </h2>
							<p>Fresh fillet of Pacific Northwest salmon grilled to perfection and served with a reduction sauce of butter, white wine and dill.</p>
							
<li><h2>Pasta &agrave; la Dian</h2>
							<p>Penne pasta served with our own fresh roma tomato-basil sauce with artichoke hearts, black kalamatra olives, garlic and prawns and of course freshly grated parmesan cheese.</p>	
														<li><h2>Strawberry Shortcake</h2>
							<p>Fresh locally grown strawberries made into a sweet sauce and fresh whipping cream atop our very own homemade biscuits.</p>
							
<li><h2>Judy's Heath Cookies</h2>
							<p>A chewy, gooey, soft cookie with Heath bar and walnuts mixed in for a crunchy delight and then baked to perfection</p>
							
</ul>
