					<h1>Social Connections</h1>
					
					

						<p>Events and activities offer the opportunity for Social Connections.  Socialization and support networks help us prevent isolation, build self-esteem and contribute to our ability to continue to grow as people.  At Art&#275;gan communities we design our events and activities to be stimulating, engaging and just plain fun. Enjoying the companionship of others is another way we're Celebrating the ART of Life.</p>
						  
<p>Here's a sample of what's on our dance card:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Volunteer opportunities</li> 
	<li>Cooking clubs</li> 
	<li>Outings to: theatrical performances, restaurants, comedy clubs, sporting events and more</li> 
	<li>Happy hours</li> 
	<li>Holiday celebrations</li> 
	<li>Gardening events</li> 
</ul>
