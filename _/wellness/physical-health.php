					<h1>Physical Health</h1>
					
					

						<p>Physical activity promotes vitality, mental sharpness, physical strength, balance and overall wellness.  Even if you've never exercised, it's not too late to start.  Physical activity will help increase your energy, be steadier on your feet and best of all will extend your life.  We couple physical activity programs with disease detection efforts knowing that early detection and treatment of certain conditions will increase the chances of positive outcomes. Physical health is another way we're Celebrating the ART of Life.</p>

						<p>Don't think small here, because there's lots to do.  Here's a sample of how we're getting and staying in shape:</p>
						
						
<ul>
	<li>Walking club</li>
	<li>Balance and strength programs</li>
	<li>Resistance training (weights)</li>
	<li>Yoga</li>
	<li>Tai Chi</li>
	<li>Ballroom dancing</li>
	<li>Blood pressure clinics</li>
