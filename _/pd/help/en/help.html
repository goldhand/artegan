<p>Unlike other postcard services, <b>Postcard Direct</b> can allow you to email the postcard
directly to the recipient rather than the recipient getting a ticket and accessing the web site to
view their postcard.</p>

<p><b>Recipient Email</b> - This is the email address of the person you want to send the postcard
to. You can specify as many email addresses as you like separated by commas.</p>

<p><b>Recipient Name</b> - This is the name of the person you are sending the postcard to. Their
name will appear in the greeting.</p>

<p><b>Sender Email</b> - This is the email address of yourself. This may or may not be
required.</p>

<p><b>Sender Name</b> - This is your name. This may or may not be required.</p>

<p><b>Subject</b> - This will appear as the email subject. This field is optional.</p>

<p><b>Postcard Design</b> - You can choose from a number of different postcard designs. Use the
<i>Preview Postcard</i> button to get an idea of what each one looks like.</p>

<p><b>Music</b> - Choose one of the midi songs to play with the postcard.</p>

<p><b>Send Formats</b><br>
There are 2 choices of formats to send the postcard in.<br>
</p>

<ol>
<li><i>Send to users with standard email accounts.</i><br>

Choose this option if the recipient uses an email client like Outlook Express, Netscape mail,
Eudora etc.

<p></p>
</li>

<li><i>Send to users to web email accounts.</i><br>

Choose this method if the recipient uses web mail (eg: Hotmail, Yahoo
etc), or you are unsure what sort of mail client they use.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that not all of these options may appear on the form depending on what sort of
postcard is being sent.</p>
