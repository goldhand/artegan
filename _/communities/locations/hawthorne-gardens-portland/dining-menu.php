							<h1>Sample Dining Menu</h1>
							<h3><a class="dk_blue" href="index.php">Hawthorne Gardens</a> - Portland, Oregon</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Here's a sample of how our professional staff combines nutrition, freshness, quality and creativity for residents to enjoy every day.</p>
							
							
							
							<h2>Buttermilk Pancakes</h2>
							<p>Fluffy buttermilk pancakes served with warm maple syrup and savory sausage accompanied by seasonal fresh fruit.</p> 
 
							<h2>Oatmeal</h2>
							<p>Old-fashioned, hearty and heart-friendly oatmeal served with fresh berries, brown sugar and/or a variety of warm syrups.  Freshly brewed coffee and selected hot teas accompany this breakfast favorite.</p>
 
							<h2>Breakfast Casserole</h2>
							<p>Scrambled eggs, grated potatoes and country ham are baked into a scrumptious casserole served with a selection of breakfast pastries, toast (white, wheat, sourdough or rye) or homemade biscuits, butter and assorted jams and jellies.</p>
 
 							
							<h2>Lemon Ginger Chicken</h2>    
							<p>Succulent chicken breasts slowly roasted to ensure juicy tenderness topped with a warm glaze of fresh lemon juice, zest and grated ginger and served over a bed of fluffy rice with steamed vegetables on the side.</p>

							<h2>Lasagna</h2>
							<p>This popular dish is made from scratch.  Buttery noodles layered with a meaty marinara sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese is baked until the sauce is bubbly and the cheese melts to a golden grown.  Garlic bread and a fresh crisp salad with a selection of dressings make this the perfect meal.</p>

							<h2>Desserts</h2>
							
<p>Our daily menus include a sampling of freshly baked pastries and cookies, ice cream and puddings.  Reduce sugar options are always available.</p>
								
<h2>Breakfast Bar</h2>
							
<p>Our breakfast bar is available daily with seasonal fresh fruit and juice.</p>
