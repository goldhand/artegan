							<h1>Sample Dining Menu</h1>
							<h3>Apple Springs - Omak, Washington</h3>
							<br>
							<p>Here's a sample of how our professional staff combines nutrition, freshness, quality and creativity for residents to enjoy every day.</p>
							
							
							
							<h2>French Toast</h2>
							<p>Residents' favorite, Texas bread dipped in a creamy egg and cinnamon mixture, grilled until golden brown and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon.</p>


<h2>Eggs Benedict</h2>
							<p>Canadian-style bacon and poached eggs atop a hot buttered English muffin drizzled with hollandaise sauce.</p>
 
							<h2>Ham and Cheese Quiche</h2>
							<p>A homemade delight created with grated cheese, chunks of honey-cured ham and fluffy eggs make this a mouthwatering breakfast favorite and it’s accompanied by fresh, seasonal fruit.</p>
 

<h2>Home Style Pot Roast</h2>
							<p>Comfort food at its finest, our special combination of herbs and spices over a savory tender pot roast cooked until fork tender and served with whipped potatoes and mushroom gravy.  Steam fresh carrots are served with your choice of drizzled ginger butter or creamy butter, and of course our freshly baked biscuits are piping hot.</p>

							<p>Flakey white fish fillet topped with bread crumbs and slivered almonds is baked to perfection and served with a crisp salad and seasonal steamed vegetables and freshly baked dinner rolls.</p>


							<h2>Hot Turkey Salad</h2>   
							<p>Tender tom turkey chunks combined with crisp celery, sweet onions, mayonnaise dressing and baked with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top for flavor and accompanied by seasonal fresh fruit and freshly baked rolls.</p>

							<h2>Judy's Heath Cookies</h2>
