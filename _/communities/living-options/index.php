						<h2>What's Best For You?</h2>
						<p>Choosing the right community might be the single most important decision you make.  You'll want to gather all the information and visit each community.  Remember the first impression is critical.  Ask for the chance to speak with current residents or their family members.  Remember you're looking for a community that fits you, your lifestyle, your needs for today and tomorrow. </p>

						<p>Our friends at HelpGuide have a <a class="dk_blue" target="blank" href="http://www.helpguide.org/elder/senior_housing_residential_care_types.htm">comprehensive list of housing options and definitions</a> on their web site.</p>

						<p>You can print our <a class="dk_blue" href="../../get-started/tools/How-To-Choose-An-Assisted-Living-Community.pdf">"How to Choose an Assisted Living Community"</a> tool and take it with you when you tour communities.</p>

						<p>The American Institute for Economic Research has a wonderful booklet titled, "How to Choose Retirement Housing" by Thomas M. Cassidy.  You'll find this a practical guide to sorting out the housing options plus helpful forms and worksheets you can use.  You can purchase this booklet from <a class="dk_blue"  target="blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Choose-Retirement-Housing-Thomas-Cassidy/dp/091361047X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207087805&sr=8-1">amazon.com</a> or by visiting the <a class="dk_blue" target="blank" href="http://www.aier.org/bookstore/research-reports/2010?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage_new.tpl&product_id=37&category_id=6">AIER web site</a>.</p><br>
