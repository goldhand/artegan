I have visited other facilities for seniors…very depressing…my conclusion: They don’t have the staff, the activities, or genuine care that Laurel Parc is privileged to have. Till we meet again…take good care of each other. <br />

<p><strong>12/5/2009</strong><br />
Seven months ago my life changed along with my address. Moving to Laurel Parc has made such a difference in my life. Living here is making me so happy. The atmosphere, the friendship, the caring from others brings much thankfulness.</p>

<p>The staff has made a definite impact on me knowing that others really do care about me. They are such a friendly group; always with a smile and warm greeting.</p>

<p>No longer do I feel alone. Yes, I do have two beautiful children who go out of their way to make me happy but I can't live in their total care. Laurel Parc fills the void.</p>

<p>There are so many activities available. Sometimes I find it difficult deciding what I want to do. Do I want to go on a scenic drive, do I want to play bridge, bingo, Mexican train, or do I just want to chill out and remain in my apartment and read or perhaps take a nap? Having all this at my beck and call makes it impossible to harbor being lonely.</p>

<p>I thank one and all for making my life full of joy and comfort. <br />

<p><strong>2009</strong><br />
Moving into Laurel Parc is one of the nicest things I've done. The minute I walked in the front door with my family I told them I didn't need to look any further. It is truly a beautiful place to live. The staff are fantastic and totally helpful to all ones' needs.</p>

<p>The monthly calendar is filled with all kinds of activities to keep one as busy as you would want to be. The entertainment is always wonderful. Laurel Parc is a wonderful place to live. <a href="../../Portals/_ExpressSite/images/testimonial.gif" target="_blank" alt="Testimonial Letter">View actual letter.</a><br />

My mother has recently settled in Laurel Parc--what a positive experience this is! I hope you feel free to share this experience with others...</p>

<p>As you know, your organization, ChoiceOregon, provided a list of 20 local continuum of care communities—what a help that was!--and we began our search for a retirement living community for my mother.  After I visited 15 of these, we narrowed the choices to 5 in terms of location, cost, appearance, amenities, and staff.  My mother and her partner then visited these with us and, in most cases, we ate a meal to sample the food choices and quality.  After careful consideration, they chose Laurel Parc at Bethany--one of only two places that passed the "food" test.</p>

<p>They moved in two weeks ago and we have all learned more about Laurel Parc since and how exceptional it is. Perhaps most importantly, the staff consistently goes above and beyond, seeking out residents, initiating conversation, and offering help in any way they can.  This level of genuine caring is quite a feat accomplished by the owners, who are frequently on-site, engaged with residents.  The tone of the community has been set by them and, as a result, 
the residents are outgoing and positive.  It is so welcoming.  The first time my mother and partner went to the dining room, they were invited to join others.  One woman who was just leaving, asked to stay to get to meet and talk with them; they related this experience to us, happy and relieved at the friendliness of their new neighbors.</p>

<p>From the activities director to the chef to the food servers, everyone has warmly introduced themselves to each one of us and asked questions that would allow them to better relate to and serve my mother's and partner's individual needs. And, they follow through, taking every opportunity to show they are sincere and dedicated to making living there positive.</p>

<p>Laurel Parc is beautifully decorated and immaculate.  Floor plans include generous closet space--a real plus to people who are downsizing. The rents are among the most affordable and the initial deposit has been waived since it is a new community.</p>

<p>A shopping area a block away has restaurants, a bank, and stores, and now a weekly farmers' market.  As with most retirement communities we saw, free shuttles are scheduled for doctors' appointments and grocery shopping runs, and that is a bonus allowing more independence than if family members were depended upon.</p>

<p>Activities are plentiful and appear on screens throughout the building. However, while most communities boast about their high quality food, Laurel Parc's chef, Ric, delivers appetizing and creative dishes. Our entire family (8 of us) ate there last night at one of their monthly candlelight dinners.  It was a memorable evening--from gazpacho and salad starters to salmon, pork, lamb, and duck entrees to 3 exceptional desserts.  We were impressed.</p>

<p>Such a monumental life change has fears and uncertainty for the residents and their families.  We are grateful and thankful to have found this community!</p>

<p>Best Regards,</p>
